</p>

Currently supports high-order triangulations and quadrilaterizations 
of smooth surfaces

This repository has an external dependency - [FMM3D](https://fmm3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest)

The package along with the dependency can be obtained by


    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fastalgorithms/fmm3dbie.git


Make sure you have the shared object for the FMM library installed and
located in an appropriate location (`/usr/local/lib` on MacOSX, and
environment variable of LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to location of libfmm3d.so 
on linux machines)


Please see the [online documentation](https://fmm3dbie.readthedocs.io).

Zydrunas Gimbutas provided the high order quadrature rules
for integrating smooth functions `src/tria_routs/triasymq.f`, 
`src/tria_routs/koorn-uvs-dat.txt`, `src/tria_routs/koorn-wts-dat.txt`,
and, `src/quad_routs/squarearbq.f`; provided `src/common/dotcross3d.f`;
and also provided all the quadrature nodes and weights in
`src/quadratures/ggq-self-quad`
